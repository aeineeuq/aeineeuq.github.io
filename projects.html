<h3>Post-2019 / BMA Engineering Projects</h3>
<div class="scroll-box"><p>
    <b>The Diversity Enabling Program</b> of projects aims to support BHP's aspirational goal to achieve gender balance by 2025. As the Program Manager, I developed and executed activities relating to end to end project management, including: creating project schedules and cost estimates, presenting business cases to gain capital funding and supporting teams to execute projects across multiple mine sites.
    <br><br><b>Autonomous Haulage</b> is expected to create a safer work environment at BMA sites. As a Project Engineer, I assisted in the safe and timely execution of civil construction works onsite to enable the improvement of the technology infrastructure. This including installing communication towers, installation of 12km fibre optic cabling and building autonomous truck calibration pads.
    <br><br><b>TLO Automation</b> seeks to move from a manual, operator-controlled Train Load-Out (TLO) system to an unmanned, fully automated train loading capability. As a Project Engineer, I assisted in facilitating the on-site project execution to replace and update the train load out weighbridge at Goonyella Riverside Mine.

<h3>Pre-2019</h3>
<div class="scroll-box"><p>I have experienced various roles in the projects space, from a Site Administrator, mobilising teams and processing timesheets through to Project Engineer/Manager roles, ensuring productivity, safety and adherence to schedules.
     My different experiences have opened opportunities to travel and work throughout QLD, as far North as Weipa and also close to home in Brisbane. I have always enjoyed working with large multi-disciplinary teams with a diverse range of backgrounds. A few notible projects include: East Weipa Tailings Storage Facility Wall Raise, Gateway Upgrade North, Former Royal Childrens Hospital Brisbane Demolition, Petrie Paper Mill Demolition and Remediation, Swickers Kingaroy Bacon Factory Demolition, Daandine Expansion Project, Arrow Energy Domestic Gas Project Dalby and Moranbah
